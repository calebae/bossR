The `bossR` package segments and tracks the cells from the BOSS method. Access to the full papers can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.17.495689v1). Additionally, it allows for visualization of the segmented/tracked cells overlayed in original image.


## Installation

You can install the development version of bossR like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('calebae/bossR')
```

## Vignette

For a full implementation of the methods with output please see our [vignette]().

```{r example}
library(bossR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
